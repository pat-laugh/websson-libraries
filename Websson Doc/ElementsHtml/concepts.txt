p::~
	There are 5 basic types of containers in WebSSON: Document, Dictionary,
	List, Tuple and Function Head.
	
	The Document consists of the file containing the whole WebSSON text.
	Therefore, it starts at the start of the file and ends at the end of
	the file. Elements within it are separated by newlines only.
	
	The Dictionary starts with an opening brace ('{') and ends with a
	closing brace ('}'). Only key-value pairs are allowed inside of it.
	Elements are separated by either a comma or a newline.
	
	The List starts with an opening square bracket ('[') and ends with a
	closing square bracket (']'). Only values are allowed inside of it.
	Elements are separated by either a comma or a newline.
	
	The Tuple starts with an opening angled bracket ('<') and ends with a
	closing angled bracket ('>'). Values and key-values are allowed inside
	of it. Elements are separated by either a comma or a newline.
	
	The Function Head starts with an opening parenthesis ('(') and ends with
	a closing parenthesis (')').
