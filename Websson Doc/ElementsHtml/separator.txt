p $desc ::~
	A separator is either a comma or a newline. A newline is an
	implicit separator, whereas a comma is an explicit separator.
	This means if two elements are separated by newlines, it doesn't
	matter how many newlines there are--they'll be counted as one. If
	a comma is present, then newlines before and after it are ignored.
