/* skip junk must have its own language where
the chars '/' and '\' are recognized as operators
-- There are multiple languages within one language
1) There is the main language
2) Language of strings
3) Language of junk

There are actually 3 kinds of operators, both consisting of two chars:
Line escape: '\' immediately followed by '\n' or whitespace or eof
Line comment: '/' immediately followed by '/'
Multiline comment: '/' immediately followed by '*'

If '\' or '/' is met, but not an operator, then it is left
where it was.

What line escape does:
	1) Skip current line. All chars after '\' must be junk or eof
		If not, there is an error.
	2) Skip whitespace on line after it.
