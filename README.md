This is a set of libraries related to the WebSSON language:

 -	`utils` contains useful functions
 -	`structures` contains WebSSON structures and keywords
 -	`parser` contains a WebSSON Parser
 -	`serializer` contains a WebSSON Serializer

Both the Parser and Serializer depend on the
utils and structures libraries.

The directory `tests` contains functional tests for the Parser and the
Serializer.
